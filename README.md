MRI  acquisition contrast classifier.  This project, currently in beta, contains software tools 
for classifying contrast weighting in neurological DICOM MRI exams, e.g. T1, T2, T2 FLAIR, PD, using different
trained ML models.  Trained models, example MRI data, documentation and tutorial will be made available during the fall of 2018.
